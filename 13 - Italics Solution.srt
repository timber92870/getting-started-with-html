1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,690
And the answer should look like this. You've got

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,045
your opening em tag, the phrase HTML is reasonably

3
00:00:06,045 --> 00:00:10,290
straightforward, and then the closing em tag. And, our

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,995
b tags are still where we left them. Hopefully

5
00:00:13,995 --> 00:00:16,390
you managed to figure this out that HTML tags

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,640
can be nested just fine and the, the whole

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,230
phrase is in italics because the whole phrase is

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,660
surrounded by these tags. And just the words reasonably straightforward

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,900
are in bold because those are just the

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,220
words that are surrounded by the b tags. Let's

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,820
experiment with that in the editor a little bit

12
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,318
here. So I'm going to take the closing em tag

13
00:00:36,318 --> 00:00:41,890
off here and put it on the back. And if we update this, we can see that the

14
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,300
whole phrase learn to love HTML is in italics,

15
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,500
and that's what we just saw on the quiz.
