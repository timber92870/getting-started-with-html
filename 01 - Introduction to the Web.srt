00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:03,520
Okay, hey everybody welcome to Unit 1. In this unit

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,780
we're going to be basically discussing the basics of the web.

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,980
So, in this unit we're going to cover the web, what

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,260
it is, what it looks like, how, how their major

5
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,402
pieces fit together. We'll talk about HTML which is the

6
00:00:14,402 --> 00:00:17,610
main document type of the web. We'll talk about URLs

7
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,430
which is how you refer to documents on the web.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,310
We'll talk about HTTP which is the protocol that unites

9
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,750
the web, that the web runs on. And then we'll talk

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,470
about Web Applications and, you know, what they are and how

11
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,420
they fit into this big picture. And this is, you know,

12
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,580
the grand finale. This is what the course is actually about.
