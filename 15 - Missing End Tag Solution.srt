1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,380
The correct answer is, everything after the opening

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,170
em tag is italicized. If your browser crashes you

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,340
should quit using Internet Explorer, and you know,

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,130
maybe this last answer is more truthful than joke,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:15,500
because [LAUGH] there's definitely a world in which

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,690
browsers behave in a somewhat. Unpredictable manner, but I

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,820
think in this in this simple example, everything

8
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:25,270
after the em tag should be italicized. And let's

9
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,510
let's try it out in our browser just to be certain. Okay, text is where I left

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,820
it. No closing em tag, update. Cool, everything's still

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,025
italicized. If I were to you know, move this

12
00:00:37,025 --> 00:00:41,720
em tag closing em tag here. And update, we

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,720
can see that HTML straightens up because just the

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,060
em is around this phrase. Enough of those simple

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:48,820
tags, let's learn something a little bit more complex.
