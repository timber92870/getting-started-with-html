00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,310
Okay. I like to teach you about a new concept. These are

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,460
called HTML attributes. They look something like this. We still have our

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,740
opening tag name and, and a closing tag as before with this

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,570
slash but we have an, a new thing called an attribute. Attributes

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:17,600
have a name, in this case, I just called it ATTR. Equals,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,390
and you've got quotes and the value is inside the quotes, and

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:23,070
attributes these days always equal a value. Didn't use to be the

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,560
case to be the case to be honest but everything we're going to

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,930
do is, is, equals a value. And tags can

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,410
actually have multiple attributes. An example of a tag

11
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,980
that uses an attribute is the anchor tag, which

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:36,480
is the a tag, and a full example looks something

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,110
like this. You've got the opening a, you've got

14
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,830
an attribute called href, you've got its value, in

15
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,120
which in this case is a URL, you've got

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,500
the contents, and then you've got the closing anchor tag.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,930
So if you were to render this in HTML we'd

18
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,060
just see the word derp, but it would be a

19
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:59,650
link to reddit.com. Anchors are for making links. Let's play

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:02,210
around with this in our browser a little bit and

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,690
see it in action. Okay, so we've got our HTML

22
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,150
from before. I'm going to clean out some of these tags

23
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,230
here, so we have a little bit more room to

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:16,100
work. Let's make the, the words HTML here a link. So,

25
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:23,792
we're going to make an opening a tag. An href to www.w3c.org/html

26
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:28,480
and a closing a tag. When we render this, we

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,630
see that HTML has turned into a link and if I were to click this it would

28
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,890
open this page, w3c.org in a new

29
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:42,030
window. Pretty neat, huh? Okay, so quick quiz.

30
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,990
Take the phrase below or take the words my favorite from the phrase below and

31
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,241
make those words a link to udacity.com.
