00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,040
Let's begin with a discussion of the World Wide

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,240
Web. The World Wide Web is a collection of

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,400
HTML documents. These documents are made up of something

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,720
called HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language. This

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,180
is the basis for almost every webpage. Even though

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,240
there can be, you know, documents, images, videos, and

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,550
you know, all sorts of things online. HTML is

8
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,220
what glues everything together, and the links between these

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:32,840
pages called hyperlinks or links for short, is what makes the web, web-like.

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,390
The web was invented in the early 1990s, and has something on the order of

11
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:43,700
30 billion pages. Time for the first quiz. What is the main type of document on

12
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,120
the web? Is it HTML, Microsoft Word documents, PDFs, or Plain Text?
