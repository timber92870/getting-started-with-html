1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,984
Let's talk about whitespace for a moment. So, you may have

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:05,504
noticed when I was entering text in the, in the editor

3
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:08,360
before, that even though I put text on multiple lines, when

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,544
I rendered it in HTML it rendered all on a single

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:14,830
line. This is because in HTML all whitespace, new lines, tabs,

6
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,250
spaces all turn into a single space. To force our HTML

7
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,770
to have multiple lines we can use another tag called the

8
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,580
br tag. It looks like this. It is also a void tag,

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,980
stands for break, and it's a void tag. And

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,229
you put this after, after any lines that you want to

11
00:00:32,229 --> 00:00:34,340
appear on multiple lines. Let's lets play around with

12
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,440
this in the browser a little bit. Here we are

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,830
in the browser. Let's let's enter some text. We've

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,440
got this text that's really too long for one line,

15
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,060
and when we render this, it appears as one line.

16
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,840
Let's put a line break here. When I render this,

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,080
it still appears as one line. If we

18
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,640
want to render multiple lines, we can enter the br

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:02,270
tag like here. No problem. And now we have a line break. And we can even enter

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,420
multiple br tags if we want multiple line

21
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:09,270
breaks. 'Kay? There we go. Two line breaks or

22
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,460
two br's equals two line breaks. Cool, huh? Another

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,860
way of doing line breaks is to use the

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:21,360
p tag. This stands for paragraph. This is not a,

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,660
a void tag. So the p tag has content and

26
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,610
it looks like this. So it's, that you know, because

27
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,700
it's not a void tag, it has a closing tag, and

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,360
we have a opening tag. So you've got opening p,

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,680
content, closing p, and this will render as one paragraph.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,050
Lets check this out in the browser really quick Okay.

31
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,190
So we've got these two lines. Let's take a different approach.

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:45,990
I'm going to start this line with a paragraph tag,

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,650
and we'll, we'll render this. Ah-ha. Now we've got a

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,710
line break here in our text. Now the font got

35
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,360
bigger, and that's kind of a side effect of our,

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,330
of our HTML tool. It must be some sort of

37
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,670
style set on p. That doesn't normally happen. I'm going to

38
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,760
wrap the, the bottom line with a paragraph as well.

39
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,344
Okay. There we go. Now we've got two lines the

40
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:08,810
same kind of basic idea as we had before.

41
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,195
Now, we'll, we'll talk about why there's this extra space

42
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:13,265
in here even though there's no space between this

43
00:02:13,265 --> 00:02:15,260
text up here. We'll come to that in a minute.

44
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:20,290
But first, quiz time. Take this text here. Hello,

45
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,750
everyone, we're using two lines now. And enter the HTML

46
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,220
to draw that as it's formatted here, with two lines.

47
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,610
And I want you to use the, the br tag.
