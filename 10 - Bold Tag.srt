1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,035
Okay, the first tag we're going to learn about is the

2
00:00:02,035 --> 00:00:04,890
b-tag and it looks like this. It's got an opening

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,170
b and a closing b. There's a closing slash. And

4
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,110
anything that appears inside the b-tag appears bold. So, this is

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:17,200
b for bold. Pretty simple tag. Let's let's play around

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,400
with this in the HTML editor a little bit. Here

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,220
we are. We got this you know, this plain text

8
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,820
that we've typed in before. Let's let's make one of these

9
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:29,470
words bold. Okay. So, I took the word love and I preceded it

10
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,230
by, an opening tag and a closing tag. And when we, when we click

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,070
UPDATE here to update this. The word love is now in bold. Pretty simple

12
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,490
huh? Quiz time. In the box below,

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,690
make the words reasonably straightforward appear bold.
