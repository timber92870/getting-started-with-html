00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:02,560
The answer should look something like this. Should be, the

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,610
HTML is, and then we have our opening b tag, the

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:11,230
words, reasonably straightforward, and then our closing b tag. It's also

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:13,750
possible to do this, and I didn't, I wasn't super clear

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:16,570
when I gave you the problem, that you could put a

6
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,240
b tag just around the word reasonably and just around the

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,720
word straightforward. But, obviously it's easier if you put it around

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,750
just the whole phrase and, you know, then you only need

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,830
one element instead of two.
