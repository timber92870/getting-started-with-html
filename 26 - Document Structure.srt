1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,430
That's enough HTML elements for now. I want to talk about the

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,770
structure of an actual HTML document really quick before we move

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:09,370
on. Now, what we've been seeing before is just little mark

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,560
up. We've been seeing things like this. You know little tags, a

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,680
few little simple tags. But an actual complete HTML document has

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,490
quite a bit more in it. Here's a whole lot more

7
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,750
HTML. Let's take this piece by piece but this is what

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:26,768
a complete HTML document looks like. First we have the DOCTYPE. And

9
00:00:26,768 --> 00:00:29,940
this is what kind of, of HTML this is. This

10
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,780
string right here is, used to be a lot more

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,540
complex. If you were to Google for DOCTYPES you would

12
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,180
see a lot of different answers here. But now that

13
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:40,610
we're using HTML5, it has a nice clean simple doc

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,730
type, which is just the string HTML. Very simple, okay.

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,660
Then we have a tag. This is the basically the,

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,850
the opening HTML tag and the closing HTML tag. This surrounds

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,170
the entire rest of the document. That's all it does,

18
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,680
is it surrounds the entire document. Now I've got this

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:01,246
other tag here, the head. This part of the document

20
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:06,230
has kind of metadata and, and another random stuff. If

21
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,220
you were to include JavaScript and CSS, CSS, remember we

22
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,880
talked about it as the filing sort of stuff, that

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,410
would be included in the head section. Now we also

24
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,870
have this little tag here, the title, and this is the

25
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,320
title of the page. This is what would appear in

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,330
the top of your browser window, or in, in your

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,770
browser tab, this string right here. Then we have the

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,580
body tag, and the body tag is the actual contents

29
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:33,190
of the document. And basically, we've been, we've been working

30
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:36,070
just in the body tag in this lesson. And for

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,080
most of this course, we're really just going to be focusing

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,120
on generating the content that fits between the body tags.

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,310
It's all this other stuff is important and you'll see it,

34
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,970
and we'll be, you know, we'll sending over the wire. But it

35
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:49,860
doesn't change very often and, you know, it's pretty simple, but it

36
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,660
is pretty important for it to be there. All of the interesting

37
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,660
stuff though happens between the body tags. Okay, let's take another

38
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,640
view at HTML documents, they have a structure that can visualized like

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,850
this. An HTML document this whole thing has a head section and

40
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,390
that's where we have our title, references to any CSS files, and

41
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,610
Java script files, and that sort of stuff. And then we

42
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,300
have the body section and this is where the actual contents of

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,570
the document, the stuff that you see on the screen. This is

44
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,230
where that comes from. And in this course where mostly going to focus

45
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:24,430
on this part of an HTML document. Just the body section

46
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,770
and there's a lot of content that can go in there. Well,

47
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,980
we'll, you know, discuss briefly, you know, CSS and JavaScript and how

48
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,810
they fit into everything. But, for the most part, we're going to be

49
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,550
generating the contents, the body, of, of an HTML document.
