1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:05,802
Alright so, let's learn another tag. This one is the image tag. It looks like

2
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:13,934
this, IMG, and this is for including images. It has the following structure. The

3
00:00:13,934 --> 00:00:20,210
opening IMG tag. It has an attribute called source, SRC equals, and this equals

4
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:25,160
the URL. This is the URL of the image to download. Remember, we talked about

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,170
how the web service can serve all sorts of different

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,910
types of content? If you're going to serve an image, this

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,100
is how you would do it. You would include it

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,630
in an image tag in HTML, and you reference the

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,220
URL. And then there's another attribute called alt. Which stands

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,620
for alternate, and this is text that gets displayed when

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,250
the image doesn't load. Its required in the sense that

12
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:51,170
HTML parses will complain at you if it's not there?

13
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,800
Nothing will break, but it's really nice to include it. So

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,880
broken requests like if, if, if our browser requested a URL that

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,260
doesn't exist, this is the text that gets displayed, and it's also

16
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,924
for blind people. You know, it doesn't take much to add an

17
00:01:03,924 --> 00:01:06,546
alt text that'll make somebody's life or somebody's day at least

18
00:01:06,546 --> 00:01:09,980
mildly easier. And one other thing I'd like to point out here,

19
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,345
is every tag that we've talked about so far has had a

20
00:01:12,345 --> 00:01:16,540
closing tag. Images don't. This is the entire tag. There's no contents

21
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,170
to an image. See? It just ends right here.

22
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,790
This is called a void tag, and a void tag

23
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,280
is a tag that has no content, and because it

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,840
has no content, it doesn't need a closing tag. Let's

25
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
try this thing out in the browser and see how

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,798
it looks in real life. Okay, so here we are

27
00:01:32,798 --> 00:01:35,680
in our little HTML previewer. Let's, let's add an image.

28
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:41,070
Okay so, we've got our, our image tag, src equals

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,330
udacity.com and hipmunk.png. This is our URL of an image that I've prepared

30
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:51,080
for us. We've got some alt text there. Let's go ahead and click Update. And

31
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,780
ta dah, there's our image. Now, a couple other things we can do. I

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,999
can put some text here. There's our text. Images just appear in line with text.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:07,090
Yeah, so a small image just appears right in the middle of other text.
