Okay guys, we are going to discuss HTML or

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,290
Hypertext Markup Language. HTML documents are the, the heart

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,170
of the Web. The Web is basically made up

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,180
of these documents that can do a number of

5
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,710
things. So HTML is made up of text content,

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,585
which is what you see. It's made up of

7
00:00:19,585 --> 00:00:22,930
markup3 which is what that content looks like or

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,230
how it's arranged. It's made up of references to

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,954
other documents, like images and videos. You may have something that looks

10
00:00:28,954 --> 00:00:31,306
like this and you've got some text and you'll have a, you

11
00:00:31,306 --> 00:00:33,884
know, an image on your page. Or like the page you're looking

12
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:36,325
at now, which has got a video in the middle of it. You

13
00:00:36,325 --> 00:00:38,855
know, the page you're looking at now is made up of HTML

14
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:42,430
and it's got references to a big fat video. And it can

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,210
be made up of links to other pages. And, I'm sure you're

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,240
very familiar with what links are and how they're used. Let's let's play

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,850
around with HTML a little bit. This is a

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,530
simple HTML editor we have so we can play

19
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,990
with things and test them out. You can follow

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,170
along by either, I think there should be a

21
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:07,842
link in the course notes, or you can also go to www.udacity.com/html.playground.

22
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:11,510
And that should get you this this little

23
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,280
page where you can kind of experiment a little bit. This is kind of a, a fake

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,940
little test browser. So, the first thing I'd like

25
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,990
to show you is that if we have just some

26
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,940
blank text. If we were to render this as HTML,

27
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,310
it would look the same. Plain text is plain text

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:31,922
in HTML, for the most part. But if we want

29
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:33,950
to make the text look different, we need to use

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,498
something called markup, which is one of the other facets

31
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,040
of HTML. And let's learn a little bit about markup.
