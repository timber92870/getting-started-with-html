00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,500
One last thing I'd like to talk about with br and

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,480
p, I'll show you right now. Let's let's make this all be

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,100
one line again, okay? So I update this and we have

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,660
one line. If we, we can put a br tag in the

5
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,780
middle of this. We don't actually have to have the line

6
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,031
breaks in our HTML. So when I click Update, we, we get

7
00:00:19,031 --> 00:00:22,670
our, our line break no matter how the HTML is formatted. So,

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,230
we can format this however we want, put all of these spaces

9
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,980
in here. And when we update this, it'll always come out the

10
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,920
same. There's an example. All this white space turns into turns into one single

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,155
space. All of these new lines here, turn into one

12
00:00:40,155 --> 00:00:45,538
single space. You know, this text space is really, you know, you get

13
00:00:45,538 --> 00:00:50,920
the idea. Okay. Why do we have two different ways of making

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,643
new lines? Why do we have a br tag and a

15
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:57,277
p tag? The answer is because the br tag is what

16
00:00:57,277 --> 00:01:00,849
we call inline, and the p tag, is what we call

17
00:01:00,849 --> 00:01:05,410
block. Now, so what the br tag was actually doing was

18
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,870
just ending a line. So when we have some text and

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,790
we put a br in the middle of it, it just

20
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,210
basically says the line ends here and this guy wraps to

21
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,160
the next line. The p tag works differently. The p tag

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,370
actually makes an invisible box. So when we have HTML

23
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,910
looks like this, this creates an actual box. So instead

24
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:26,640
of just rendering text, blank line, what this is actually

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,420
rendering is something sort of like this. Here, we've got

26
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,420
two lines of text and there's actually this invisible box

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,310
around text. And that's what the p tag does, is

28
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,870
it makes this invisible box. And this invisible box can

29
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:41,620
actually have height, and it can have width, where inline elements

30
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,510
are just text. So the example over here would be

31
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:46,848
more like this. So it's just two lines of text and

32
00:01:46,848 --> 00:01:49,910
there's really just a little new line here. There's nothing nothing

33
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,410
fancy going on. And the difference between inline and block elements

34
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:57,440
will come up a fair amount later in this course

35
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:00,478
and it's just it's important to know that there's a distinction

36
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:03,810
and they have kind of a different behavior. So far, all

37
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:07,160
of the elements we've learned other than p are inline elements.

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:13,880
So, inline elements are b, em, even img is

39
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,770
an inline element. And we saw how, before, our our little Hipmunk image appeared

40
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,160
right in the middle of the text. That's because it's inline. And

41
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,130
so far, the only block element we've learned is the p element.
