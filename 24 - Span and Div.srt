Two more elements I'd like to teach you.

0:00:01.230,0:00:03.320
These are called span and div.

0:00:03.320,0:00:05.170
Span and div are both normal elements.

0:00:05.170,0:00:06.320
They can both have content.

0:00:06.320,0:00:12.400
And the only difference between these two is, span is inline, and div is block.

0:00:12.400,0:00:14.450
We'll play around with these in the editor a little bit,

0:00:14.450,0:00:17.970
but these elements don't do anything other than just contain their content.

0:00:17.970,0:00:21.110
And there's a way to attach styles to them,

0:00:21.110,0:00:25.010
to adjust different behaviors of how they display.

0:00:25.010,0:00:27.030
That looks something like this.

0:00:27.030,0:00:29.160
So you can see I've added two attributes, or

0:00:29.160,0:00:31.140
an attribute to each of these called class.

0:00:31.140,0:00:34.680
And this is a CSS class, and this is not something we're going to

0:00:34.680,0:00:38.780
spend a whole lot of time on in this course, I'll provide most of the CSS.

0:00:38.780,0:00:42.850
But it's a separate language for adding styles to your documents or

0:00:42.850,0:00:46.010
changing the, changing how different text looks.

0:00:46.010,0:00:47.340
And we'll be using spans and

0:00:47.340,0:00:51.230
divs a lot for, you know, controlling how text is laid out.

0:00:51.230,0:00:55.750
But the important thing to remember is that spans are inline and divs are block.

0:00:56.790,0:00:58.830
Let's play around with these in the browser a little bit real quick so

0:00:58.830,0:00:59.940
you can see what I'm talking about.

0:01:00.970,0:01:02.450
Okay, so we've got our text.

0:01:02.450,0:01:07.330
And my first line is wrapped in span, and it behaves as,

0:01:07.330,0:01:09.830
as we would expect an inline element to behave.

0:01:10.980,0:01:13.830
Now if I were to change the span to a div,

0:01:15.670,0:01:20.570
it behaves more like how the paragraph tag before behaved.

0:01:20.570,0:01:26.530
This div is actually this, creates a box around this piece of text and

0:01:26.530,0:01:29.440
you can see my, we actually did something interesting, I added a little period

0:01:29.440,0:01:33.940
after the div and the period appears down on the second line here.

0:01:35.760,0:01:38.250
What I'd like you to do is check all the elements that are inline.

0:01:38.250,0:01:40.830
Some of these elements you haven't seen before.

0:01:40.830,0:01:44.929
So I would like you to try them out in your own browser and

0:01:44.929,0:01:47.078
figure it out for yourself.
