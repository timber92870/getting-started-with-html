Let's change it up a little bit. I'm going

2
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,840
to delete this closing em tag, and I'd like

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,000
you to tell me what happens when we don't

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,670
have the closing em tag. In our previous example, we

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,510
had an opening em tag and I left off

6
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:14,410
the closing tag. When happens when we forget to

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:20,760
close that em tag? Nothing is italicized. The browser crashes.

8
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,200
Everything after that opening em tag is italicized or,

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,850
I don't know, your guess is as good as mine.
