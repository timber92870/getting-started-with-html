1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,410
Okay, let's take a step back for a second and talk about the major pieces of

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,290
the Web, or, or, or the major concepts

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,700
we're going to be discussing in this lesson. The major

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,530
pieces are you, your computer running a Web

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,190
browser, the Internet, and servers. Your browser makes requests

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:22,270
via the Internet to servers. These requests are

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:26,520
using a protocol called http and the servers respond

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,310
with files that your browser displays. Some examples of browsers are

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,900
Internet Explorer, Chrome, Firefox. You're probably running one of

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,560
those right now. These servers are computers just like yours

11
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,770
except they are optimized for sitting in

12
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,790
a closet and hosting files rather than sitting

13
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,551
on your desk, you know, browsing these files. And the protocol http that we are

14
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,936
speaking is, is just a very simple protocol that your

15
00:00:53,936 --> 00:00:57,291
browser uses to communicate with these servers. We'll discuss each of

16
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,610
these pieces. Well, we won't spend a whole lot of

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,700
time on the Internet, but we'll discuss each of these pieces

18
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,950
in turn throughout this lesson. Okay. Time for another quiz.

19
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,870
What I'd like you to do is, take the letters that

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,770
are near each piece of technology we just discussed and match

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,840
them up with their name and definition. Your options are HTTP,

22
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,930
the main protocol of the Web. Servers, computers that host the files that make

23
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,140
up the Web. The Internet, the worlds

24
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,770
largest computer network. And your browser, a

25
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,060
program that runs on your computer to display files found on the Web. Take

26
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,330
the letters next to each piece of technology and put them in the correct box.
