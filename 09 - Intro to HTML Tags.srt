00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,110
HTML markup is made up of things called tags.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,640
Tags look something like this. The way a tag is

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,490
structured is, you've got, a less than symbol, the

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,020
tag name, a greater than symbol, the tag contents, which

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,960
can actually be other tags or it could just

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,940
be text, another less than symbol, a slash, the name,

7
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,430
and a greater than symbol. There's two ways that I

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,058
might refer to this. We'd call this the opening tag.

9
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,360
This one, the one with the slash in front of the

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,220
name, we call this the closing tag. The names are always

11
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,065
the same, and the only difference is the closing tag has

12
00:00:33,065 --> 00:00:35,780
a slash in front of the name. So you've always got

13
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,690
name, contents, name. Opening tag, contents, closing tag. Now, I'll also

14
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:45,350
refer to this whole thing as an element. And, you know,

15
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,890
this, this isn't something I'm, I'm really going to quiz you on.

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,240
I just want you to, you know, understand that when I'm talking

17
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,850
about HTML I may refer to a tag or I may refer

18
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,180
to the whole thing as the elements, or sometimes I kind of switch the

19
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:59,250
words a little bit. But, that's what I'm referring to. I'm just

20
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,810
referring to, you know, this structure here. Let's learn about our first tag.
