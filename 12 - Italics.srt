I want to teach you about another tag. This one is

2
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:05,580
called the em tag. It stands for emphasis, and it makes

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,700
things italic. It looks like this. You've got the opening

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,650
em tag, contents, and then the closing em tag with the

5
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,410
slash. Same structure as the bold tag. Nothing too nothing

6
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,770
too complex here. Let's try it out in the browser really

7
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:21,020
quick. Okay, so here we are in our browser again.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,450
Let's make the word learn italicized. So all I do is

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,760
I put an opening em tag and then I put a closing em tag, and I hit Update.

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,700
And that took the word learn and made it italicized. What

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,530
I'd like you to do is take the whole phrase below and make it italic.
