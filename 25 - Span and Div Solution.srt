Okay, so the answer the inline elements are a, the anchor tag, the span tag, the

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,990
image tag, the strong tag, and the line

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,820
break tag is actually considered inline. This one

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,150
is, is a little tricky, but the br tag doesn't have any with, it doesn't behave

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,670
like the other block elements do, it doesn't

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,520
make like a box on the screen. It just

7
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,670
creates a newline. So, anyway, hopefully you managed to

8
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,420
figure that one out or you learned something today.
